editmenu

this script is intended to be placed within the pythonista action menu.  when run, it provides a small toolbar on the right that stays up while editing files, and has some useful buttons.

indent will indent the selected lines.  unindent completely unindents the lines to match the least indented..., rather than try to figure out how many indents the current block is.

execlines takes the current block -- which could be at some arbitrary indent, and executes it in the console, useful for debugging.

Latest file includes comment/uncomment block, and select/copy/paste
